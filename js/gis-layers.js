/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · WHAT IS ON THE MAP, AS A DATASET — window.IntMapGisLayers   (#R732)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  #R729 gave the app one registry of datasets (js/gis-datasets.js) and one set of operations that
 *  read from it and write back into it. Everything the reader DROPPED could enter it. Everything
 *  the app itself had already drawn could not: the earthquakes, the ships, the World Heritage
 *  points, the outbreaks, the file another module put on the map — all of them are real features,
 *  held in a real source, and there was no door from any of them into the registry. 「地図に出て
 *  いるもので分析する」 had no entrance, which is the same shape #R729 removed for imports.
 *
 *  This file is that door, and it is only a door: it decides nothing about geometry, typing or
 *  storage. It finds what can hand over features, hands them over whole, and registers them.
 *
 *  ══ THE LIST IS DISCOVERED, NEVER WRITTEN ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  Two populations are counted, not enumerated:
 *
 *    · the LAYER REGISTRY (window.IntMapLayers) — every id whose state() answers and whose
 *      featuresIn() returns an array. Today three modules register and exactly one of them
 *      implements featuresIn through its own body; the rest go through js/map-ui.js's shared
 *      window on the renderer's sources. ⚠ WRITING THAT DOWN WOULD FREEZE IT. The fourth module to
 *      implement featuresIn must appear here by existing, not by being added to a list —
 *      .agents/rules/no-ad-hoc-hardcoding.md §2-4.
 *    · the RENDERER'S GEOJSON SOURCES — read off the parsed style, so a source that no layer row
 *      speaks for (an uploaded file, a module that draws without registering) is still reachable.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE SAME FEATURES ARE NOT OFFERED TWICE. A registered layer usually reads one of those very
 *  sources, so the two populations overlap. The overlap is MEASURED by object identity — the
 *  feature objects a layer hands back are the ones the source holds, not copies — rather than by
 *  guessing a source id from a layer id, which no rule connects.
 *
 *  ══ WHAT IS READ IS WHAT IS THERE ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  read() hands back the features as they are: full geometry, full properties. Nothing is reduced
 *  to a bounding box or to a centroid on the way — a line that becomes its midpoint cannot answer
 *  「道路そのものからの距離」 (see js/gis-geometry.js), and a polygon that becomes its box cannot be
 *  clipped. The only thing that can remove a feature is a bounds the caller asked for.
 *
 *  ⚠ 「ALL OF IT」 IS ASKED AS A WORLD BOX, because the layer contract has exactly one door
 *  (featuresIn(bounds)) and no word for 「everything」. A layer that has answered for
 *  [[-180,-90],[180,90]] has answered for all of its content.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND THE BOX TEST ITSELF IS NOT WRITTEN HERE. js/map-ui.js owns the one predicate the whole app
 *  uses and now publishes it as IntMapLayers.featuresInSource; a second one in this file would be
 *  the same judgement kept in two places, and the copy is always the one that keeps yesterday's
 *  mistake (that predicate dropped every line and polygon until this round).
 *
 *  ══ PROVENANCE IS THE RECIPE, AND THE PROJECT STILL SAVES THE BODY ════════════════════════════
 *  {kind:'layer', layer, bounds, at} says 「いつ・どのレイヤーの・どの範囲を読んだか」: it is enough
 *  to run the read again, which is what a recipe is.
 *  ⚠ AND js/gis-project.js WILL STILL SAVE THE FEATURES, because it stores a body for every
 *  provenance whose kind is not 'op'. That is the correct behaviour here and not an oversight: a
 *  live layer's content changes with the hour (the ships moved, the quake list rolled over), so
 *  re-running this recipe tomorrow does not reproduce today's answer. What must survive the tab
 *  closing is 「あのとき読んだもの」, and only the body is that.
 *
 *  ⚠ sourceCrs IS 'EPSG:4326' AS A STATEMENT OF FACT, not a default. These features come out of a
 *  MapLibre GeoJSON source, and the GeoJSON specification (RFC 7946 §4) fixes that coordinate
 *  reference system for every source the renderer accepts; js/geo-import.js has already reprojected
 *  anything that arrived otherwise before it could reach a source. So this is the one origin in the
 *  app where 「what arrived」 is known rather than declared by the file.
 *
 *  ⚠ EVERYTHING IS INSIDE THE FACTORY (tests/r175 ③) and window.* is read at CALL time, so this
 *  module imports in Node with no DOM: sources() is empty and every entry point refuses by name
 *  instead of throwing.
 * ==========================================================================*/
